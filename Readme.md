# Formatting Services - an example of use


<p>This example demonstrates the use of XtraScheduler formatting services. <br />
They can be helpful if you have to modify the display format of text contents for visual elements according to the end-user requests. Clients often get used to certain date-time or numerical representations, and the application deployment can be performed much smoother if their requirements are met. Clicking the <strong>Custom Format button</strong> performs a service substitution, modifying display formats of appointment start and end times, Timeruler scales, header captions, and header tooltips.</p><p>For more information on XtraScheduler services see the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument4106">Services</a> section in the documentation.</p>
